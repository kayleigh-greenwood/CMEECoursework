echo -e "\nThis is a shell script! \n" #Prints a message to the console with empty lines above and below it

#what does -e do? -e enables interpretation of backslash escapes (enables interpretation of shortcuts inside the quotation marks). 
#what would happen without -e? There would have been no empty lines above or below the text, and the \n would have printed out either side of the text
#what does \n do? \n means 'new line' and so inserts a line of empty space

#exit
