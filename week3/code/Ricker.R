# difference equation, not differentil equation
# discrete time equation
# updating the value of a variable with respect to what its value was in a previous time step
# r is growth rate parameter
# taking value from particular time step, mlutiplying by growth factor and ...
# simulating this equation in the script
# function takes value of pop at time 0, assigns values incase values arent passed to the function and it can be run wihtout arguments
# rep function used for preallocation to create empty vector containing NAs, has address in memory and ready to receive information
# N[t] line is the replication of the equation within the scri[t]
# returns n, then plots r
# gives figure
# says index because as default it has assumed they are values in a vector

# k can fluctuate as many things can affect carrying capacity
# r (growth rate) could fluctuate. r is the same as fitness of the population
# r is a property of the organism. hiw fast can it grow with no constraints? will fluctuate with temperature, and other factors. 
# we are taking r and multiplying it by k which accoutns for competition
# N can fluctuate. migration can affect N. density-independent-death can affect N (eg lightening hits the population)
