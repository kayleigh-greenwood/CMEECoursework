Question 3: 'Variables in shell scripts', the last part of the first assignment wouldn't run and wouldnt show sum of numbers. 
Answer: i hadn't seen that they were single quotation marks and not apostrophes
Detail: second to last line of code was in the guidebook as mysum='expr $a + $b'. This didn't work for me so i did some googling and changed to the suggested format on google. I used mysum=$(expr $a + $b) and it worked. 
solved via: realising that other people's code had worked, i copy and pasted the code from the website and it worked, and realised i must have copied it out wrong and realised i hadn't seen that the single quotation mark was an apostrophe.
