    \section*{Introduction}
    
    about population growth curves
    how population growth curves are typically modelled in the literature

    objectives of this study

    Explain mechanistic vs phenomenological in the context of population growth
    Explain why i am comparing a model of each type
    why i chose the mechanistic model that i did
    why i chose the phenomenological model that i did




    Example of reference \cite{verhulst1838notice}.


    \section*{Methods}

        Describe the mathematical models i fitted and compared to the data, and which methods i used to do this.

        Describe how i compared and selected models and why i used the methods i did (AIC/BIC)

        \subsection*{Data}
        
        \subsection*{Computing tools}

        Describe which biological computing tools i used for each section of the workflow and how i chose those tools
        
        states briefly how each of the scripting languages (bash, R, Python) was used and what packages within them were used and a justification of why.
